# Controlled vocabularies for CCMM

The CCMM for research data works with a list of controlled vocabularies, some of which are maintained by the National Library of Technology (NTK), even though they originate from external sources. This repository contains the contents of those specific controlled vocabularies that are curated by NTK.

All vocabularies used in CCMM should be applied in their original form, without modifications.

A complete list of all controlled vocabularies used — including those managed by NTK and those from external providers — can be found in the table below.
